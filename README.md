# Prison
In this project, we plan on executing prisoners based on the given order. At first, it requires an input from the user to determine the number of prisoners overall; then it will need another input as the order of executing to execute prisoners accordingly. This project was written in C++ (includes GUI version written on Qt Creator). Written by Danial Goodarzi, Hossein Hosseini
